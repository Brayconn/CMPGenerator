Are you a Cave Story modder?
Are you tired of generating long CMP/SMP scripts by hand?
Have you always wished there was an easier way to generate CMP/SMP commands?
Well look no further than CMPGenerator!
The world's only modern, fully-fledged, and gluten free, CMP/SMP command generator!

(In the event your script becomes game crashingly large, simply use the "tsc_malloc" Booster's Lab .xml file (developed by SlightlyIntelligentMonkey and Clownacy) to increase the max size of .tsc files. A copy has been provided for your convenience.)
